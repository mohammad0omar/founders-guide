<h1>SaaS Business Models for Achieving $1M ARR</h1>
<h2>Key Insights from Bessemer Venture Partners</h2>
<h3>Calculating the Path to $1M ARR</h3>
<ul>
<li>The number of customers required depends on your target market and product</li>
<li>Enterprise clients: Fewer deals (as few as five) with higher contract values</li>
<li>SMB segment: Could require several hundred customers with smaller deal sizes</li>
<li>Define your target Average Annual Contract Value (ACV) to estimate customers needed</li>
<li>Higher ACVs require more personalized, high-touch sales approach</li>
<li>Lower ACVs allow for more scalable, volume-driven strategy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Founder-Led Sales</h3>
<ul>
<li>Founders should be their company's first salesperson</li>
<li>Drive the first 20+ customers personally</li>
<li>Selling on your own teaches you about customer pain points, needs, and decision-making</li>
<li>Early customers buy into your vision, which founders can communicate best</li>
<li>Aim to close at least one deal with a "total skeptic" (not just from existing relationships)</li>
<li>Don't count sales to former colleagues or strong existing relationships as accurate indicators</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating an Effective Sales Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on three key areas:</li>
<li>Define your ideal customer profile (ICP) and key buying personas</li>
<li>Choose your sales model</li>
<li>Select a sales motion</li>
</ul>
<h4>1. Define Your Ideal Customer Profile</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make your ICP "uncomfortably narrow"</li>
<li>Identify key decision-makers in your deals</li>
<li>Understand the nuances of the problems you solve</li>
<li>Focus on one ICP at a time, perfect serving them before expanding</li>
<li>Be prepared to adjust if your ICP evolves or becomes the wrong fit</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Choose Your Sales Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>Options include:</li>
<li>Product-led growth (PLG)</li>
<li>Direct sales</li>
<li>Channel partners</li>
<li>Marketplaces/platforms</li>
<li>Selection depends on your product and how customers want to buy</li>
<li>PLG works well for products that are easy to use with low entry barriers</li>
<li>Direct sales is better for unique, complex, or difficult-to-explain products</li>
<li>Channel partnerships can help reach broader markets (e.g., Stripe's partnership with Shopify)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Select a Sales Motion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Three main categories: small, mid-market, and enterprise</li>
<li>Each has its own cost structure, sales cycle, and required effort</li>
<li>Enterprise motion has longest cycle and highest cost, but highest ACV</li>
<li>Focus on one motion at a time; trying to do all three simultaneously is extremely difficult</li>
<li>Each motion requires distinct resources to close and deploy deals</li>
</ul>
